# AppFlowy-CI

Cloud integration tests use `https://localhost`. The workflow generates a short-lived
localhost certificate, installs its CA in the runner's system trust store, and
configures the server and Flutter client to use HTTPS/WSS. Public Form routes
reject plaintext HTTP, so changing the cloud URL back to HTTP breaks submission
tests. Keep certificate verification enabled when reproducing this setup.

Run the workflow regression checks with Python 3, PyYAML, and OpenSSL installed:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s .github/scripts
```
